# Neon JavaScript SDK

This the Neon Wallet's JS SDK for the NEO blockchain platform. It is currently in use by [Neon](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-wallet/).

Special thanks to [neowallet.js](https://github.com/neochainio/neowallet/blob/master/js/wallet.js) for providing many of the underlying cryptography and network methods!

## Quick Start

Import the package using `npm install --save git+https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-js.git`.

Alternatively, download the source files and build using `npm run build` and test using `npm test`.

Take a look at the tests to find examples for all API functions.
